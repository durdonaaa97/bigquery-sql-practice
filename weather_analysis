## Weather Data Cleaning Query

This query extracts weather station data from the **NOAA GSOD 2020 dataset** in Google BigQuery.  
It cleans missing values by replacing placeholders with `NULL` or `0` where appropriate.

- **Dataset:** `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.gsod2020`
- **Weather stations:** La Guardia (`725030`), JFK (`744860`)
- **Fixes applied:**
  - `9999.9` → `NULL` for missing temperatures
  - `"999.9"` → `NULL` for missing wind speeds (converted to Float64)
  - `99.99` → `0` for missing precipitation values
